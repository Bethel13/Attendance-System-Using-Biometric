Attendance System Using Facial Recognition

📌 Overview

This project is a real-time biometric attendance system that leverages facial recognition technology to automate attendance tracking. The system captures a person's facial features, verifies their identity, and records their attendance. It also overlays student information such as name, ID, major, academic standing, year, total attendance, and starting year on a background image.

🚀 Features

Real-time facial recognition for attendance logging

User authentication for secure access

Database integration to store attendance records

Student information overlay on a background image

Live camera feed for facial detection

Admin panel for attendance monitoring and reporting

🛠️ Tech Stack



Backend: Python (Flask/Django)

Machine Learning: OpenCV, dlib, Face_recognition

Database: Google Firebase





🎯 How It Works

The camera captures a real-time image of the student.

The facial recognition model processes the image and matches it against the database.

If a match is found, the system logs the student's attendance and overlays their information.

The administrator can access attendance records and generate reports.

🛡️ Security & Privacy

Face data is encrypted before being stored.

Role-based authentication ensures that only authorized personnel can access records.

Data privacy measures comply with GDPR standards.

📌 Future Improvements

Mobile app integration

Multi-factor authentication

Cloud-based storage for scalability

Improved accuracy with deep learning enhancements
